## Startup Stream App

- A Project Similar to Y Incubator where great minds can share their Startup information
- The Project is made with Next.js 15, while making sure to benefit from the Partial Prerendering
- The content of the startups are handled through the use of the Headless CMS "Sanity"
- Live Demo: [Click here](https://startup-stream.vercel.app)

First, run the development server:

```bash

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
